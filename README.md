## Project Overview  

**PowerShare** is an **AI-powered FinTech platform** that democratizes investment in clean, small-scale energy infrastructure across Africa.  
The initiative supports **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7** — ensuring access to *affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all*.

Despite Africa’s vast renewable potential, the continent receives **less than 2% of global clean energy investment**, leaving nearly **600 million people without electricity**.  
PowerShare bridges this gap through **blockchain-based crowdfunding**, **AI risk assessment**, and **mobile payment integration**, connecting global investors with local renewable projects.

## Core Concept  

> “Empowering everyone — from rural entrepreneurs to global investors — to share in Africa’s renewable energy future.”

### How It Works  
1. **Project Listing:** Local renewable developers list solar, wind, or bioenergy projects on PowerShare.  
2. **Investment Marketplace:** Global investors browse and fund vetted projects using fiat or digital currencies.  
3. **Smart Contracts:** Blockchain ensures transparent, traceable transactions and fractional project ownership.  
4. **Profit Distribution:** Automated revenue sharing through tokenized returns.  
5. **Community Wallets:** Locals pay for electricity via **mobile money** or prepaid digital tokens.

## Engineering Economics Application  

PowerShare applies **engineering economics** to evaluate project feasibility, optimize investment, and forecast long-term sustainability.  

### Example Case: *Tariro’s Solar Mini-Grid in Malawi*  

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Initial Investment | \$7,000 | Cost of solar mini-grid system |
| Annual Net Revenue | \$1,300 | Earnings from local energy access |
| Project Duration | 10 years | Expected useful life |
| Discount Rate | 8% | Time value of money |
| Present Worth (PW) | \$8,723.13 | PV of cash inflows |
| Net Present Worth (NPW) | **\$1,723.13** | Positive → Financially viable |
| Annual Worth (AW) | \$256.75/year | Annualized profit |
| Future Value (FV) | \$18,831.80 | Total projected return after 10 years |
| Capitalized Cost (CC) | \$6,250 | Present cost for perpetual maintenance |

**Conclusion:** The project is economically viable and socially impactful — it increases access to power while providing sustainable returns.

## Implementation Feasibility  

**Technological Readiness:**  
- Built on existing **mobile money**, **cloud**, and **blockchain** systems already used in Africa.  
- Uses **AI-driven risk assessment** to attract investors by minimizing uncertainty.  

**Potential Challenges:**  
- Limited internet access in rural areas  
- Low awareness of clean energy finance  
- Evolving regulatory environment for crypto and crowdfunding  

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- Phased rollouts in high-connectivity regions  
- Partnerships with NGOs and local microgrid developers  
- Education and training programs

## SDG Alignment  

| SDG Target | PowerShare Contribution |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **7.1** – Universal access to modern energy | Expands off-grid solar mini-grids to rural communities |
| **7.2** – Increase renewable share | Crowdfunds clean energy projects |
| **7.A** – Support clean energy R&D | Encourages innovation through digital investment tools |
| **7.B** – Expand infrastructure | Provides capital access for decentralized systems |
